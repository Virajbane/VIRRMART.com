Title: E-Commerce Website Inspired by Amazon with Creative Touches (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Creative Touches:

Unique Layout: I've implemented a custom layout that stands out from the standard e-commerce template while maintaining user-friendliness.
Interactive Features: I've added interactive elements like product carousels, hover effects, or animations to enhance user engagement (optional).
Customization: You can further personalize this project by adding features like user accounts, wishlists, or product filtering mechanisms (optional).
Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the website's structure and content.
CSS: For styling the website and defining its visual appearance.
JavaScript (Optional): For adding interactivity and functionality (e.g., form validation, product carousels).
Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the website.
Feel free to explore the code within the html, css, and js folders (if applicable) for understanding and customization.

This repository contains the code for an e-commerce website I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While inspired by the structure and functionality of Amazon, I've also incorporated unique creative elements to set it apart.
